# DDQN-ALNS weights for VRPTW

Trained controller weights for the hybrid DDQN-ALNS solver in
[VRPTW Neural Hybrid Solver](https://github.com/Thundercok/vrptw-neural-hybrid-optimizer).
The network selects destroy/repair operators and acceptance behaviour inside an
Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search over the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time
Windows.

## Files

| File | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `rl_alns_dr_v15.safetensors` | Domain-randomization checkpoint. Loaded by default. |
| `rl_alns_transfer.safetensors` | Transfer-learning checkpoint (Solomon RC classes). |
| `gnn_edge_predictor.pt` | Edge-scoring GNN used for repair heatmap guidance. |

## Results

Under independent cold starts, the hybrid reaches the same minimum vehicle-count
floor as the ALNS baseline but hits it in 100% of runs versus 30-70% for the
baseline, and cuts total distance by 1.75%-4.07% at matched vehicle count on
Solomon and 200-customer Homberger instances. At 400 customers the vehicle-count
edge is small and only significant on two of three instances tested
(`c2_4_1` p=0.0078, `r2_4_1` p=0.0156; `rc2_4_1` p=0.3750).

## Usage

These are controller weights for a specific solver, not a standalone model. The
checkpoint can be downloaded independently:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

path = hf_hub_download("{repo}", "rl_alns_dr_v15.safetensors")
```

See `src/vrptw/solvers.py` for the controller weight-loading implementation.
