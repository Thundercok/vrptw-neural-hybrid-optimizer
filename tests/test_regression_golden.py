"""
Solver fingerprint regression test.

Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the optimisation work are behaviour-preserving by design:
they remove Python/Numba marshalling overhead and redundant recomputation without
changing which moves the search makes. This test enforces that — if a "pure speed"
change shifts (nv, cost) at all, it changed the search, and that is a bug.
Wall-clock-limited MILP recombination is excluded from these fingerprints.

Regenerate the baseline with:
